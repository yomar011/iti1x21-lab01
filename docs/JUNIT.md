# Running junit Tests

Do not commit the junit files.

Prerequisites to the tests working:

All files must be present.

All files must compile.

All files must have the exact name expected.

All methods must be present with the exact name expected.

All methods must have the exact signature expected.

Even if you could not complete a particular exercise, the files
must be included, they must compile, and contain all the method
definitions required by the exercise.

* [Download junit 4 jars](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install)


## Usage:

For running the tests, you need the two libraries: junit and hamcrest.

You can use them using two options:

(1) adding the jar files containing the libraries in the same folder as the unit tests

 OR

(2) updating your CLASSPATH.


## Option 1

If you have NOT updated your CLASSPATH to point at the junit libraries, then:

1. Copy all your .java files, the test files, junit-4.13.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar into one folder.

2. From that folder, compile and run TestL01.java:
Under macOS, Linux, or Unix in general:

```
javac -cp junit-4.13.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. TestL01.java
java -cp junit-4.13.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. TestL01
```

Under Windows

```
javac -cp "junit-4.13.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;." TestL01.java
java -cp "junit-4.13.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar;." TestL01
```

***

## Option 2

If you have updated your CLASSPATH to point at the junit libraries (for instructions on how to do that, please see the setup requirements and instructions below), then:

1. Copy all your .java files and all of the test files into one folder

2. From that folder, compile and run TestL01.java:

```
javac TestL01.java
java TestL01
```


Setup:

Instructions for updating the CLASSPATH:

1. Download junit and Hamcrest-core jars.

2. Update your CLASSPATH.

For Windows:

Go to Setings> Edit the system environment variables > Environment variables > System variables > CLASSPATH.

Add two new entries containing the paths that point to the downloaded jar files. For example:

```
C:\javalibs\junit-4.13.jar
C:\javalibs\hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
```

For macOS/Linux/Unix:

Add to .bash_profile (or run in terminal each time):

```
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/Users/yourusername/lib/java/junit-4.13/junit-4.13.jar:/Users/yourusername/lib/java/junit-4.13/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:.
```

replace "yourusername" with your username.
